Internally, all data is adminstered with primitive data types for
performance reasons. Externally, all classes offer a great deal of
functionality and convenience.
</p><p>
</p><p>
The general convention for all classes is the following:
</p><p>
Operations can be performed using two sets of methods. To multiply,
for example, two instances <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> of a
class, you may either call 
</p><p>
<center>
<code>C = A.times(B)</code> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <code>C.assignTimes(A,B)</code> 
</center>
</p><p>
to store the result in <code>C</code>. In the first case, a new
instance is created, in the latter this is avoided.
</p><p>
All operations follow this convention, and data types mix: 
</p><p>
To multiply and instance <code>A</code> with a double <code>d</code>
</p><p>
<center>
<code>A = A.times(d)</code> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <code>A.assignTimes(d)</code> 
</center>
</p><p>
Entries can be accessed using <code>set</code>- and
<code>get</code>-methods and various data types.
