This package provides classes for special matrices. 
<p>
{@link mfc.matrix.AbstractComplex2By2} is the basic class to represent
complex two-by-two matrices. Most of its functionallity is implemented
in protected methods. 
<p>
Both {@link mfc.matrix.Complex2By2} and @link mfc.matrix.ComplexPolynomial2By2}
are derived from {@link mfc.matrix.AbstractComplex2By2}.
