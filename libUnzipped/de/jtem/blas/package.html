The <b>b</b>asic <b>l</b>inear <b>a</b>lgebra <b>s</b>ystem is a package that provides
classes for integer, real, and complex matrices and vectors; which forward the actual calculations
to the corresponding methods of the jTEM packages <a target="_top" href="http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/jtem/mfc">mfc</a> and

An important feature of blas is the wide range of
operations that mix the different types.
</p>
<p>
Vectors and matrices are internally represented as arrays of ordinary
types (int and double). These arrays are one-dimensional for vectors
and two-dimensional for matrices. This representation has performance 
reasons. The data can be accessed by and easily passed to other methods.
