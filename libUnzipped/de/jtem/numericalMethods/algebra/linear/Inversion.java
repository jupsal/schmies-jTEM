/**
 * Computes the inverse of a square matrix.
 * <p>
 * This algorithm is implemented for both real and complex valued equation
 * systems.
 * And each method is again available in two version.
 * <p>
 * One version is an optimized version that consumes as few resources as
 * possible.
 * Moreover it is possible to pass objects that this method can store temporary
 * results during computation in them.
 * This is for example useful when calling this method multiple times so there
 * is no need for this method to allocate memory again and again.
 * If null is passed for the temporary objects then suitable objects are
 * allocated by the method itself.
 * <p>
 * The other version is an easy to use version that takes care of for example
 * not changing any arguments where not expected.
 * But this version can sometimes be very resource consuming!
 * <p>
 * Method versions for Inversion:
 * <blockquote>
 * <table border="2" cellpadding="6">
 * <tr>
 * <th></th><th>optimized</th><th>easy to use</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <th>real valued</th>
 * <td>{@link #compute(double[][],double[][],double[],double[]) compute(A,...)}</td>
 * <td>{@link #compute(double[][],double[][]) compute(A,I)}</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <th>complex valued</th>
 * <td>{@link #compute(double[][],double[][],double[][],double[][],double[],double[],double[],double[]) compute(A,...)}</td>
 * <td>{@link #compute(double[][],double[][],double[][],double[][]) compute(A,I)}</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * <em>
 * This class does not check any arguments for validity!<br />
 * For identical arguments results are undefined!
