 * Computes for a system of equations RX=B with given right triangular matrix

 * systems.
 * And each method is again available in two version.
 * <p />
 * One version is an optimized version that consumes as few resources as
 * possible.
 * <p />
 * The other version is an easy to use version that takes care of for example
 * not changing any arguments where not expected.
 * But this version can sometimes be very resource consuming!
 * <p />
