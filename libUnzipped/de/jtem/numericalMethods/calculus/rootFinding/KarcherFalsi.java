/**
 * KarcherFalsi is an improved regula falsi for finding bracketed roots.
 * The main weakness of the regula falsi is that usually only one endpoint
 * of the bracketing interval is improved and that therefore during many
 * iterations interval halfing would have been better. 
 * KarcherFalsi counts how often the improved approximation of the root is
 * on the same side of the interval. A weight proportional to this count
 * moves the next regula falsi approximation towards the other endpoint.
 * To avoid overshooting the weight depends quadratically on the ratio
 * of the two most recent approximations where the function has the same
 * sign.
 * As few function values as possible are computed.

//	%% ....... Part 2,  The improved regula falsi ............. <<<============<<
//	%% THEORY for this program:
//	   % Standard regula falsi replaces a function (with different signs at the
//	   % endpoints of an intervall) by its secant, then takes the zero of the 
//	   % secant as the improving iteration. This has two weaknesses:
//	   % (1) Usually only *one* endpoint is improved under the iteration -- this
//	   % onesided convergence happens for example if the 2nd derivative does
//	   % NOT change sign.
//	   % (2) Often intervall-halfing is dramatically better than regula falsi,
//	   % for example for f(x) = exp(x) - 1, starting on [a,b] = [-12, +10].
//	   %
//	   % THIS  PROGRAM  avoids these weaknesses by computing a weight from the
//	   % ratio between the last function value and the other most recent value
//	   % with the same sign. With this weight the zero of the secant is moved
//	   % towards the endpoint which was NOT changed on the last iteration.
//	   %
//	   % Program details. COUNT keeps track of the bad cases, it says how often
//	   % the same side was improved in a row. INDEX is either 1 or 2;
//	   % arg(index) is the endpoint which was improved in the last round, and
//	   % arg(3-index) was not so recently improved.
//	   % WEIGHT  is *quadratic* in the ratio of function values: 
//	   %      (most recent value / previous value with same sign)^2, 
//	   % so that a significantly improved value results in only a *small* shift
//	   % of the zero of the secant. Also, weight < = 1, so that the zero of
//	   % the secant is at most shifted to the midpoint between this zero and
//	   % the unimproved endpoint.
//
//
//	if sign(leftValue) * sign(rightValue)  <= 0,                   % otherwise do nothing
//	   index = 1;     count = 1;    iteration_steps = 0;    % initialize
//	   
//	% ..... Start with one unmodified linear interpolation, detect endpoint-zeros:
//	if leftValue == 0, u = arg(1);       % needed for the case leftValue = rightValue = 0
//	else
//	 u=( arg(1)*rightValue - arg(2)*leftValue )/(rightValue - leftValue); % linear interpolation
