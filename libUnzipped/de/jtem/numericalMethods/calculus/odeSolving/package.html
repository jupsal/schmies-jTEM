    Algorithms for solving <em>ordinary differential equations</em>.
    <pre>
    You define an ode using via the interface {@link ODE}.
    <pre>
    Currently we have provide implementations for 3 adaptive
    ode solvers: {@link RungeKuttaFehlberg},{@link BulirschStoer}, and {@link Extrap}.
    {@link Extrap} is the most sufisticated and allways worked best for us.
    For situations where performance rules over accuracy we implemented also a
    simple {@link RungeKutta} method.
    <pre>
    Have a look at {@link ExampleODE} to learn more about how you define
    ode's and solve them using this package.
