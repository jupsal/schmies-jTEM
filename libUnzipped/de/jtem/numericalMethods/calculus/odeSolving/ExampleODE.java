/**
 * This classs illustrates the usage of the ode solvers.
 * We solve a second order example: 
 * 
 * x''(t) = - x(t);
 * 
 * The obvious solutions are sin and cos.
 * We have to translate this into a first order ode.
 * <pre>
 *  x'(t) = y(t) and y'(t) = -x(t) 
 *  </pre>  
 * The ode  is defined using the interface {@link ODE}:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * ODE ode = new ODE() {
 *	  public int getNumberOfEquations() {
 *		return 2;
 *	  }
 *	  public void eval(double t, double[] x, int offsetX, double [] y, int offsetY ) {
 *		  y[offsetY] 	 = x[offsetX + 1];  	
 *		  y[offsetY+1  =-x[offsetX];
 *	  }
 *	};
 * </pre>
 * The most sufisticated ode solver is {@link Extrap }, it has many tuning
 * parameter and if you want to solve an ode many times you should
 * create an instance of it, but it can be used also in the following static
 * manner:
 * <pre>
 * double [] x = new double[]{1.0,0.0};
 *  Extrap.solve( ode, x, 0.0, Math.PI, acc );
 * </pre>
 * The initial values are given in the array x for t0=0 and yeal to x(t) = cos(t).
 * On output x will hold the result for the time t1=&pi;, e.g. -1 and 0. 
 * @see ODE, Extrap
