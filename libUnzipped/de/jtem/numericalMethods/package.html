The package numericalMethods is a collection of 
mostly standard routines providing numerical 
solutions for many common problems in algebra,
calculus, and geometry.

They were implemented avoiding fancy class
hierarchies to keep the code as simple as possible.
Thus most of the functionality is realized using
static methods with parameters of ordinary types.
This guarantees a high reusability of the code
and allows an easy integration into new projects.
A further benefit of this ascetic java-programming-style
is that it helps to minimize internal dependencies
which allows to use this code easily as a blueprint for
further developments.
