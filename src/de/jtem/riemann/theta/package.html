This package provides a comprehensive library for
Riemann theta functions.
<p>
The approximation theoretical background of this implementation is
described in detail in the paper <em>Computing Riemann Theta Functions</em>:
<p>
For a first introduction we refer to the description of the core of this package: {@link riemann.theta.Theta}.
<p>
With {@link riemann.theta.AbelianFunction} we provide an example implentation to illustrate the use
of this package. We recommend to have a look at this <em>before</em> you write your own applications.
